#misc 
Let me describe a feeling that I used to label tiredness. Groggy, puffy eyes, burning feeling spreading through my brain, localizing at a sharp, dense, heavy point in the back of my skull, weighing, pulling me down - I feel trapped, unable to do anything. I have since realized that while tiredness may play a part, I can be tired without feeling this way - there is something else going on. I believe the answer is existential stress - when I feel threatened, I shut off in this way. The central consequence is that I cannot feel any feelings or see any of my thoughts - they are separated from me as though by a wall, a wall saying "nothing that does not address the existential threat can pass." 

An anecdotally supported hypothesis of mine is that this is actually a two-way street, this wall is not just a consequence but has feedback into my overall state - hence to feel better, an approach is to gently begin to notice thoughts and feelings by writing them down as the day goes on. This is like warming up a muscle - and is really just a mindfulness practice - just not a meditative one, and focused internally. I guess that as I push back this wall and create space for myself, I feel more secure in my existence and more present.
