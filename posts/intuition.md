Intuition does not always mean you are able to navigate a game that does not have structural principles. Sometimes it means that the structural principles are not written down, but you are still able to detect some of them. It is nice to then “hardwire” the rules, so that your behaviour and thought instinctively follows the rules - at this point you may be said to have intuition.

The key distinction is that often this process happens entirely below the surface of consciousness, so that you end up with behaviour and thought obeying structural rules you aren’t even aware of. 

In soccer for example, a great player knows nothing of what he does or why. He has subconscious intuition steering the ship. This does not mean that there are no rules - his brain still is computing probabilities and making decisions based on those probabilities, just all behind the curtain of consciousness. Intuition here is how well your brain subconsciously computes these probabilities.

There is nothing wrong with detecting the rules consciously and writing them down, and then following them by choice and not by instinct - it does not make you any less talented. 

In a sport like soccer for example, this is tough because it happens too fast for conscious decision-making. But take something like programming - you have time to stop, go through a list of principles, choose an approach to your problem based on these principles, and then update your principles based on how well your approach works. 

Question: what is the time complexity of such a process? How does the brain speed this up by making it subconscious?
