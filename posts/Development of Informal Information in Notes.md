As initiated in [[Informal Information In Math]], I want to give myself avenues to include and demarcate informal information, such as mental imagery, sketch-type ideas and intuition, etc. I also want to include and demarcate feelings about the mathematics and personal context. Here is an update on the techniques:

1. Spiritual callouts: 
For these, I have chosen wizard Grothendieck as the background. Of course, his perspective on math had some structural overlap with theology, but it is a bit tongue in cheek. I have a hotkey rigged to set up callouts, and from there i just type in the tags 'intuit' or 'image.'

Mental imagery callout:
> [!image] Example.
> Example.

Spiritual intuition callout:
> [!intuit] Example
> Example

2. Emotional callouts:
For these, I have set up a template that lets me select an image from a library that I can moderate. I hit a hotkey to insert template, toggle select the desired template, and boom.
<div style="background-image: url('https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/An_angel_leading_a_soul_into_hell._Oil_painting_by_a_followe_Wellcome_L0030887.jpg'); background-size: cover; background-position: center; padding: 2em; border-radius: 12px; margin-top: 1em; position: relative; color: white;">
  <strong>Example angry feeling.</strong><br>
  <div style="backdrop-filter: blur(10px); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 6px; color: #c9c9c9;">
    
  </div>
</div>

3. Personal context:
I have chosen Monet's lilies beneath a bridge, since I recall a nice story about a scientist (cannot remeber who) having a breakthrough while walking over a bridge and looking at the reflection in the water. Triggered in exact same way as spiritual callouts.
