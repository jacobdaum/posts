title: Consumerism and Identity Parameter Space
---
#misc 
Corporate monopoly discretizes personality/character - instead of having a smooth distribution of products to choose between, you choose from a few discrete options provided by monopolies - there is no pair of boots made by a leathersmith from a village you passed through, shirt knit by a family friend - just homogeneous products with no spatial, cultural or personal roots, except in the most abstract, disconnected sense.Â 

The next idea is that this phenomenon happens with idea / thought capital as well - monopolies of opinion / thought emerge, to which people tend to conform. We do not have access to a smooth distribution of opinions or even topics of discussion via current media format - structures are polarized to a small number of views or ideas about a small number of topics. Part of this is perhaps about preservation/perpetuation of ideas - even in the case a media consumer is prompted somehow to form an original thought, there is no common avenue for preserving the thought (generally people do not write down / store ideas), whereas the media-sponsored topic-opinions are broadcasted perpetually on loop.
