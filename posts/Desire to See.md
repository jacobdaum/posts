Kant famously claimed that, if you had been born and raised wearing a pair of red-tinted goggles, you would believe the sky to be red. This thought experiment has bothered me more or less for my whole life - any interaction I have with, or perception I have of underlying reality, assuming there is such a thing, only makes sense modulo my specific "processing mechanism." I crave to interface with underlying reality more directly, without the barrier of my own subjective lens, to know what it is like independently of my own perspective. 

Of course, to interface outside the framework of a perspective seems to mean to cease to exist in some meaningful sense - part of existing as an individual is to have your own perspective. 

We will return to this - but for now let's get a little funky. A key quality of complex systems, like us, is that we create a map of the territory around us, i.e we collect information and store it in nice ways together. Perhaps what I crave is just more information, not necessarily dissolution of self - if I could replace my map with one that contains all the information of my map and far more, would this be satisfying? This would align with the biological imperative to design informative maps, as to better adapt to situations and ultimately reproduce. 

Perhaps I want all the information - this would essentially mean there is no distinction between my map and the (classical) world around me. The world would have to be effective (and it is), in that there must be reality beyond a certain cutoff that does not affect the evolution of the emergent classical world I live in - otherwise my map could never contain all of the information at this level.

Somehow, though, this just does not seem to be true - my map is very very good already, and does not do the trick! 

The gap seems to be between predictive power and the power to feel - I guess there is no linear relationship between these things. What is seeing something without being external to it, other than being it and feeling its experience? I do not want to be outside of the system looking in, experiencing a sophisticated model of the system - I want to be the system, to feel what it is like to exist as the system. When I see a tree, or blade of grass, or a mountain, I want the experience of this majestic outcropping of the world to be part of my own, all experience to be just one experience. 

The truth is, this is a serious case of getting ahead of oneself - like trying to run before being able to crawl. I spend the majority of my time unaware of my own experience, and I am largely detached from my feelings (as I believe we all are). Perhaps, even, the 'desire to see' is really just a manifestation of my frustrations with my own distance from myself - I am far from my experience, far from my feelings, and in frustration I externalize, turning to the world and screaming, 'why are you so far from me?' 

The answers seem to end up lying within, as always.
