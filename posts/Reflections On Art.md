Nontriviality Of Ideas In Math

Levels of awareness in art:

1. Unaware that it is reflection of internal perception as in [[Desire to See]] - it is honest attempt to recreate the world objectively
2. Aware that it is reflection of internal perception, but unaware of how it is situated in relation to its medium
3. Aware that it is reflection of internal perception and how it is situated in relation to medium, but unaware of how it is situated in relation to audience
4. Aware that it is mediating a relationship between artist’s perception/feelings, the medium, and audience’s perceptions/feelings^A4 ^d091bc

My preference:
1. Awareness of variation of texture, color, curvature of boundary across piece
2. Awareness of local and global deformations of space, texture, colour
3. Solid contrast of colour boundaries

Are these really properties of the piece of art? Or properties of my own processing that affect the interaction between the art and me - this interaction which we should really relabel to be the art itself.

Art is a relationship, and so we should hold it to the standards of one. 

What is your job as the viewer? To be aware of what the piece is telling you, as above, but also to project your own feelings onto the piece, voluntarily and involuntarily, and to be aware of this process as well. 

What is the job of the piece of art? Yes, to have the awareness [[#^d091bc]], but also to provoke and demand the communication of the viewer, and awareness of the viewer.

I like character, which I hope to interpret in terms of rigidity - a piece with a ball painted on an ambient background is less rigid than a piece with a ball carved into an ambient background, since the ball can “move around” within its own media context, the paint, in the first example. 

If the freedom of the ball is part of what the piece is trying to tell you, then any painting with this message must have the same structural composition, and then there is a new conceptual-compositional rigidity which overshadows the spatial mobility the ball gains.

In general, a piece in which one can alter many things without altering the experience of the art in some sense should be said to have less character. Character is then related to information - flesh this out tomorrow.

The moral of the story is that a piece blind to its own medium, i.e missing that information, should on average be able to have its medium deformed and toyed with, with minimal effect on the art experience. NOT SURE THIS IS WHAT i mEAN

  

Modern art cant be recreated faithfully in gift shop type items because the relationship to viewer is lost

  

Modification: the relationship to viewer is modified, not lost. Now, the viewer is swarmed by the images at grotesque scale. Can you incorporate this new phase into your art itself? Do artists already do this, is the assault on the senses waged by kitschy consumer art items actually by design, to punish the system that produces it?
