**Goal #1: Enjoy life and feel good**
	**Subgoal A: Enjoy math and feel good doing math**

Conjecture:
1. The "root" barriers of goal #1 and subgoal A are the same, namely existential pressure to "perform" at some level cripples the self

Assuming this conjecture holds, it then makes sense to just speak of "addressing the main goal," of enjoying life and feeling good. Specific strategies can then be used if necessary to translate to the math experience specifically.

General ideas that have helped:
1. **Reflect quite often, maybe daily, on the fact that your existence is worthwhile unconditionally.** Seriously, unconditionally - you don't need to accomplish anything, be anything, go anywhere, nothing at all - you can just sit in a chair and watch time pass for your entire life (you may not want to do that though, sounds boring), and there is nothing at all wrong with that, you can do that and feel good about it. **It is your life and nobody else's.
	1. To specialize to math, you can reflect on the fact that you have no obligation to do any math, or to have any level of mathematical ability - you can just **exist**.

Just to clarify, I'm not advocating to stop doing cool things. My perspective shift is that you need to do a thing because you are interested in that thing, not because you feel you should be doing things. I don't think it is possible to make this change without first unlearning, as above, the idea that you must be productive to be of any value.

2. **The body stores stress physically too.** I think the existential pressure you feel to have a certain level of productivity and have a certain level of ability is physical as well as mental - it reflects itself in the state of your nervous system. So to really make progress in this unlearning, there has to be physical change as well, via meditation probably. Look into **restorative yoga** - this has helped me relax a lot. Anecdotally, I had rationally convinced myself that my existence is worthwhile unconditionally, but still just didn't **feel it** - I think part of that is your nervous system firing like crazy. Doing reflection #1 while doing restorative yoga helps sync these things up. This stuff is largely inspired by stuff I read from Dr. Ellen Langer's (Harvard) work on mindfulness and the mind body connection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk9AmwQrs04

3. **Reconnect with curiosity in safe way away from math.** you make some progress in that direction, you'll find you have a lot more "emotional room" to explore your interests/curiosity. I.e instead of having strong feelings of guilt and shame pointing you towards doing one specific thing, you'll feel the world open up a bit. A good thing to do to nurture this is to pick a podcast on something you like, and make a list of the topics that come up you find interesting. For me, it is a podcast where they interview a scientist from a totally different field every episode. My list looks something like:
	1. Muon colliders: engineering challenge of accelerating particles to high enough speeds in their $10^{-zillion}$ short lifespan
	2. Detecting life "agnostically," i.e in a way that would detect life that is not carbon based, using topological properties of chemical networks on planets
	3. Figuring out why "agency" emerges from "adaptation" from an evolutionary perspective

4. **Reconnect with mathematical curiosity:** Without any pressure, learn about a math thing you are curious about, and write down a couple things you find interesting. Idea is to shift focus from "I have an obligation to learn this" to "I am learning precisely the things I find interesting about this concept." If you are not curious about anything atm, just don't do this. Don't feel pressure to read all the prereqs - just learn about the thing itself that you are curious about.

Again, not advocating for skipping prereqs in general - i just think thinking about exciting stuff is an important intermediate step.

5. **Ultimate goal**: Have "emotional room," i.e no negative feelings pulling you away, and energy to **find everything you study interesting** **- or at least to be able to look at it at an angle you find interesting**. For e.g first time I learned group theory, I was in a rush to catch up for algebra II and felt guilt and shame at not already knowing the material. I somehow did not let my curiosity wander because of this pressure - when I went through the second time, I took time to appreciate plenty of things that may not have been "productive" - for e.g finite groups are built out of simple blocks, and there is ambiguity in how you glue the blocks together - this is a recurring theme in math (manifolds, schemes, everything seems locally trivial) but why??? Is there some kind of meta-theorem about how categories with simple pieces and gluing data give interesting math?
