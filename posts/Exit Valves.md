title: Exit Valves

#misc 
At times, I get caught up possessing a belief system that I believe impacts me negatively. For example, believing I am fundamentally not smart enough to do math - not big enough to play soccer - not loveable enough to be in a healthy relationship - etc. Or sometimes, it is more mundane - believing that restaurant food is better than home cooking. These belief systems are reinforced both emotionally and rationally, and I suspect the emotional reinforcement is much the stronger.

I discuss a technique, *finding exit valves,* by which i exit these belief systems, via two readings/interpretations. 

The techniques:
1. I find small details that invoke emotions totally at odds with the belief system - then I algorithmically focus on these examples whenever the belief system is relevant/in mind. For example, if I am obsessed with something and feel like it is the only thing I want to do - I can focus on some tiny detail that I hate whenever that thing pops into mind, and eventually the belief system loses its grip. 
2. I find ways in which the belief system shares structure with other belief systems - from here, it becomes overwhelmingly likely that this new belief system is not organic, but just a reflection of other feelings and belief systems. For example, not feeling smart enough for math is structurally the same as not feeling big enough for soccer - this makes it likely that this belief system is born out of insecurity and fear, rather than truth.

> I have a mental image of a belief system being some sort of sphere that I occupy, as well as others simultaneously - an exit valve is then a hole I climb out of the sphere through. In this imagery, the geometry of the belief systems is highly nontrivial.

Interpretation A: I have some universal feelings, beliefs, and thoughts, outside the context of the belief systems I am operating in, that I can appeal to, like "higher courts," to change belief systems. The next question that comes to mind is whether the universal feelings, beliefs and thoughts are just another level in a hierarchy, and maybe there are more beyond? What is the structure of this hierarchy? Is it even linear like this? 

Interpretation B: Some other part of me uses these tools to change me. I.e if some part of me believes insecurity about intelligence and math is bad for me as a system, it gathers tools from outside the belief system with which to tear a hole, drop a line and yank me out.
